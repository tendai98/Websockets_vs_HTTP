Two SignalR projects I made  to compare speed of Websockets against HTTP. Just a fun project really.
If you want to run the projects you can get the images on DockerHub using:

- docker pull ennox/signalr_benchmark_ahttp		(For the HTTP Version)
- docker pull ennox/signalr_benchmark_websockets	(For the Websocket version)
